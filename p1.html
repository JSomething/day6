Tokyo ramen is made with pork and chicken broth and features slightly curly, moderately wide noodles. Very often in Toyko you'll find broths that are flavored with dashi, a broth made from dried smoked bonito flakes and sea kelp. This dashi-chicken hybrid is a cross-breed of Chinese-style soup broths with the lighter Japanese broths used in traditional Tokyo soba (buckwheat noodle) shops.

The bowls are generally seasoned with shoyu and are medium-bodied. Up until the recent popularity boom of tonkotsu ramen, Tokyo-style pork and shoyu ramen was probably the most widely known world-wide.

It's a kissing cousin of Yokohama ramen, which comes from across Tokyo bay. Yokohama's broth tends to be heavier, with a more meat-forward profile than the dashi flavors found in Tokyo ramen.
